# OTT-Recommender
 Leveraged Natural Language Processing and clustering algorithms to develop popularity-based and content-based recommendation systems.

### Overview
This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis project focusing on Over-The-Top (OTT) media services. The project dives into an extensive dataset containing 8807 entries across 12 distinct features, aiming to uncover insights into the consumption patterns, preferences, and overarching trends within the OTT landscape.

Beyond mere analysis, this project stands out by incorporating a recommender system designed to suggest movies and TV shows to users based on various criteria. This feature leverages the insights gleaned from the data to provide personalized recommendations, enhancing the streaming experience.

### Technologies Used

- Python for data processing and analysis
- Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for data manipulation and machine learning
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and documentation
- Natural Language processing techniques such as tokenization
- Libraries like matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

### Project Outcomes

1. In-depth OTT Data Analysis: Explores patterns, trends, and user preferences within the vast world of digital streaming.
2. Recommender Systems: 2 Algorithms to suggests movies and TV shows based on content similarity as well as user preferences.
3. Interactive Visualizations: Dived into compelling visual representations of the data, making the analysis accessible and engaging.
